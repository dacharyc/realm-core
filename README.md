![Realm](doc/logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables - check out [realm.io](https://realm.io).

This repository is a fork that holds the source code for the core database component used by all the Realm Mobile Database products. It's forked for personal use by a dev who is interested in only one SDK:

* [Realm Swift/Objective-C](https://github.com/dacharyc/realm-swift)

Realm Core is not in itself an "end-user" product with a publicly stable and supported API.

## Building Realm

How to build Realm Core is described [here](how-to-build.md).

## License
